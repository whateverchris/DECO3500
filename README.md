# Project Name - Seize Sound
# Overview
- Seize Sound is an augmented reality platform that allows users to create and interact with virtual marks based on captured sound, which appear as if they are in the user's real world location
- The Wiki page will include a series of completed design process from finding a design opportunity to come out a solution based on user testing.
- Hope to demonstrate the entire user interaction process through the whole fidelity model which giving users an authentic experience.

# Project Name - SmartCane
# Overview
The daily life of blind and visual impaired groups is complex even with the current accessibility facilities. It is still hard for the blind and visually impaired groups to walk and navigate without companies.
Hence, according to the current situation of the blind and visually impaired groups, the concept is aimed to improve how blind and visually impaired groups access; more specifically, aims to provide a more efficient and effective navigation system for the group.
